# Geometry


The IGA concept relies on the fact that the geometry (domain) is divided into subdomains, and each of these subdomains is the image of a **Line**, **Square** or a **Cube** by a geometric transformation (also called a **mapping**), that we shall call a **patch** or **logical domain**.

The following example shows a domain (half of annulus) that is the image of a logical domain using the mapping **F**. Each element (or cell) $Q$ of the logical domain is then mapped into an element $K$ of our domain, *i.e.* $K = \mathbf{F}(Q)$.

Coordinates in the logical domain are defined by the variables $\left( x_1, x_2, x_3 \right)$ while the physical coordinates are denoted by $\left( x,y,z \right)$.

## How to define a geometry?

Depending on your problem, you can be in one of the following situations;
- your geometry is trivial, *i.e.* it is a **Line**, **Square** or a **Cube**. In this case, just use the **SymPDE** adhoc constructors, for which you'll define the bounds.
- your geometry can be defined using an **Analytical Mapping**. See the next section.
- your geometry can be defined using a **Discrete Mapping**. See the next sections.
