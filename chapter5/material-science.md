These examples cover a variety of materials science scenarios, including heat conduction with phase change, elasticity with thermal expansion, creep in viscoelastic materials, diffusion and reaction in porous media, and piezoelectric materials. The weak formulations are presented in a variational form suitable for finite element methods. Adjustments can be made based on specific material properties and numerical considerations.
