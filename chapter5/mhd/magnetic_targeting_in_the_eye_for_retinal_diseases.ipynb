    "Use a mesh representing the vitreous humor.\n",

    "Boundary Conditions:\n",
    "- Simulate fluid dynamics within the vitreous humor.\n",
    "- Release drug-carrying particles near the retina.\n",
    "- Apply external magnetic fields for precise targeting.\n",

    "Initial Conditions:\n",
    "- Set up initial conditions for the vitreous humor.\n",
    "- Release drug-carrying particles from a specific location.\n",

    "These test cases provide a starting point for simulating Magnetic Drug Targeting using the Finite Element Method. Considerations include the choice of mesh, fluid dynamics simulation, and the incorporation of magnetic fields for guiding drug-carrying particles to specific targets within the body. The models should be adapted based on the specific characteristics of the targeted tissue and the drug delivery system.\n",
