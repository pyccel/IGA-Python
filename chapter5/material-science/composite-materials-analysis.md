# Composite Materials Analysis


These examples cover various scenarios in composite materials analysis, including laminate plate bending, composite shell structures, composite beam analysis, composite shaft analysis, and composite pressure vessel analysis. The weak formulations are presented in a variational form suitable for finite element methods. Adjustments can be made based on specific composite properties and numerical considerations.
