# Additive Manifacturing Process Simulations


These examples cover various scenarios in additive manufacturing process simulations, including thermal simulation in powder bed fusion (PBF), fluid flow simulation in directed energy deposition (DED), structural simulation in fused filament fabrication (FFF), multi-material simulation in material jetting, and residual stress simulation in selective laser melting (SLM). The weak formulations are presented in a variational form suitable for finite element methods. Adjustments can be made based on specific process parameters and numerical considerations.
