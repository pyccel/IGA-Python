# Composite Materials


These examples cover various scenarios in composite materials, including homogenization, thermal conductivity, fiber-reinforced composites, composite materials with piezoelectric fibers, and composite materials with thermal expansion. The weak formulations are presented in a variational form suitable for finite element methods. Adjustments can be made based on specific composite properties and numerical considerations.
